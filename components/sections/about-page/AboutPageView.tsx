/* ABOUT PAGE · composition
   The dedicated /about page, built like a case study: the Echo hero masthead,
   the reused case-study Ledger as a vitals strip, an Intro reading column,
   a numbered Experience list, a Current Project spotlight (TASKTROX), a GitHub
   contribution snake, Credentials (certs ledger + education), and the shared
   home-page Contact form as the closing CTA.
   Editorial is the base language; the Ledger is woven in at the top as vitals. */
